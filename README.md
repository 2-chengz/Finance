# Sell Side Infrastructure in a Box

<b>Premise:</b> Buy side getting poor value from sell side research.
	<br><br>
  Evidence:<br>
		Declining commission pools
    <br>
		Sell-side shops closing / firing
    <br>
		Utilization of non-sell side research 
    <br>
		Mergers to gain scale

  Impact:
		<br>
    Fewer but larger shops
    <br>
      Conflict of interests for larger shops around banking/relationship management etc
      <br>
		More “free talent” of analysts - this is a catalyst
    <br>
    Less diverse equity research sources

<b>Go To Market:</b><br>
We should look to enable the “free talent” of analysts to run their own mini sell side shops. While big firms have to gain scale, individual talent can provide value by being more nimble and flexible.
	<br><br>
  Evidence: <br>
    Smaller shops have been able to maintain profitability / survive
    <br>
    Emergence of “One man shops”
    <br>
    Ad-hoc research models from buy-side
    <br>
    Digest-like paid research sources from industry outsiders eg. Stratechery, Daring Fireball etc
<br>
We should look to replicate and scale research creation / distribution / payment processes 
<br><br>
<b>Proposed Strategy:</b>
<br><br>
1. Map out research creation/distribution/payment process.
<br>
2. Identify key parts of the process that is least dependant on other products/services/integration
<br>
3. Productize that portion of the flow
<br>
4. Acquire customers for product
<br>
5. Target adjacencies to productize and expand
